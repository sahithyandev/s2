Let $f: \mathbb{R}^2 \to \mathbb{R}$. Normal line at point $P$, is the line passing through $P$ and
perpendicular to the tangent plane. The equation of the normal line is:

```math
\frac{x − x_0}{F_x(x_0,y_0,z_0)}=
\frac{y − y_0}{F_y(x_0,y_0,z_0)}
```

## To a surface level

Let

- $F(x,y,z)$ is a 3-variable function
- $S$ is the level surface of $F$ at $F(x,y,z)=k$
- $P = (x_0,y_0,z_0)$ be a point on $S$

Normal line to the surface $S$ at point $P$, is the line passing through $P$ and
perpendicular to the tangent plane. The equation of the normal line is:

```math
\frac{x − x_0}{F_x(x_0,y_0,z_0)}=
\frac{y − y_0}{F_y(x_0,y_0,z_0)}=
\frac{z − z_0}{F_z(x_0,y_0,z_0)}
```
