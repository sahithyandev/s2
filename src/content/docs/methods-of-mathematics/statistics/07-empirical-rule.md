Applies to normal distributions.

- The probability of area between mean and +or – 1sd is 0.68.
- The probability of area between mean and +or – 2sd is 0.95.
- The probability of area between mean and +or – 3sd is 0.997.

## Chebyshev's Theorem

For any $k\gt 1$, at least $1-\frac{1}{k^2}$ of the values lie within $k\sigma$ of the mean.

```math
P(-k\sigma < X < k\sigma) \le 1-\frac{1}{k^2}
```
