A smooth curve obtained by smoothing the frequency polygon.

When the number of intervals gets large, the frequency polygon will consist of a large number of line segments, and the frequency polygon approaches a smooth curve. Useful to have some idea about the shape of the frequency distribution.

## Properties

### Skewness

Measure of asymmetry.

### Kurtosis

Measure of peakedness, relative to a normal distribution.

High kurtosis indicates a more peaked distribution. They have a distinct peak near the mean, decline rapidly, and have heavy tails.

Low kurtosis indicates a more flat distribution. They have a flat top near the mean, decline slowly, and have light tails.

### Measures of central tendency

Describes the distribution in a single value. Any measure indicating a centre of a distribution is called the measure of central tendency.

A measure of location is a quantity that locates a particular position in the frequency distribution. 

Mean, median and mode are the commonly used measures of central location.

## Types

## Symmetric

A distribution is symmetric **iff** it is the same on both sides of the mean.

## Skewed

A distribution is skewed **iff** it is not symmetric. One tail of the curve is longer than the other.

### Positively skewed
When the long tail is on the right side of the curve.

### Negatively skewed

When the long tail is on the left side of the curve.
