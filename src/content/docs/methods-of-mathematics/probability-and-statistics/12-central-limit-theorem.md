## Definition

The probability distribution of
sample mean will be normal or nearly normal, if the sample size is
_large enough_.

Generally, sample size of 30 is considered _large enough_.

Suppose $n$ random sample observations are taken from an infinite population, with $E(X) = \mu$ and $Var(X) = \sigma^2$. This sampling distribution of "the mean of $X$" (say $\bar x$) can be specified as:

```math
\bar{x} \sim N\left(\mu, \frac{\sigma^2}{n}\right)
```
