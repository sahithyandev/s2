### Combination

A selection of a set of objects, regardless of the selection order.

### Permutation

An arrangement of a set of objects, with regard to the order of the arrangement.

## Rule 1

Suppose there is an experiment consisting of $k$ number of steps. And $i$-th
step having $n_i$ number of outcomes.

```math
\text{Total number of outcomes} = \prod_{i=1}^k {n_i}
```

## Rule 2

Total number of combinations of $n$ objects taken $r$ at a time is:

```math
^nC_r = \frac{n!}{(n-r)!\; r!}
```

## Rule 3

The number of permutations of $n$ objects taken $r$ at a time is:

```math
^nP_r = \frac{n!}{(n-r)!}
```

## Rule 4

The numebr of circular permutations of $k$ objects taken from a group of $n$
objects:

```math
\frac{^nP_k}{k} = ^nC_k \times (k-1)!
```

## Rule 5

Suppose a multi-set $M$ contains $n$ items of $k$ different types. There are
$r_i$ number of type $i$ objects. Total number of distinct permutations:

```math
\frac{n!}{\prod_{i=1}^k {r_i!}}
```
