Recording of my CODD module kuppy session, covering from basics to combinational
logic, is available on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfCgnu0eYzs).

Programmability is the differentiator between computers and circuits.

## Analog and Digital

Analog devices and systems have continuous time-varying signals.

Digital devices and systems are an abstracted version of analog systems with
finitely many discrete states. 2 states are commonly used: HIGH (1) and LOW (0).

### Comparison

- Digital is more immune to noise and interference
- Errors can be detected and corrected in digital systems
- Because of the above reasons, results can be reproduced more accurately in
  digital systems
- Digital hardware is simpler, cheaper, and more reliable
- A particular digital hardware can perform different functions with
  programming. Analog hardware would require a re-design
- Storing analog signals is harder than digital signals
- Digital hardware support modular design
- Digital systems are faster for most computation while analog systems are
  better for specific tasks (eg. continuous signal processing)
