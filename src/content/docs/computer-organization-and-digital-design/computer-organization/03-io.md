Consists of input devices and output devices.

## Techniques

### Programmed I/O

- CPU has direct control over I/O
  - Continuously sense status â€“ Poll
  - Read/write commands
  - Transferring data
- CPU waits for I/O module to complete operation
- Wastes CPU time

### Interrupt Driven I/O

CPU does its own work without waiting. When I/O device is ready, interrupts CPU.

Steps:
- CPU issues read command
- I/O module gets data from peripheral whilst CPU does other work
- I/O module interrupts CPU
- CPU requests data
- I/O module transfers data

### Direct Memory Access (DMA)

DMA transfers data directly to/from memory without CPU intervention.
