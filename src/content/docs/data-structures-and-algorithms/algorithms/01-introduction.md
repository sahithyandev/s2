Revise [S1](https://s1.sahithyan.dev) for
[algorithms](https://s1.sahithyan.dev/programming-fundamentals/b-book/algorithms/).

Defines how input is mapped to output, where input and output are both
representation of data. Has a well-defined procedure. A step-by-step method of
solving a computational task. Algorithms are studied to easily understand and
solve problems in the best way.

### Computational task

A group of tasks with varying inputs.

## Algorithm specification

Algorithms are explained in either:

- Flowcharts  
  A diagram that shows a flow of control.
  - Terminals - rounded rectangles, represents start or end of the algorithm
  - Input/Output - parallelogram
  - Process/Stored data - rectangles
  - Decision - diamond
- Pseudocode
- Program listing

## Algorithm types

### Greedy algorithm

An algorithm that makes the locally optimal choice at each stage with the hope of finding a global optimum.

### Brute Force algorithm

An algorithm that tries all possible solutions and selects the optimal solution. Solution is optimal. Time of execution can be huge.
