A data structure that stores key-value pairs. Keys are unique, and map to a
value.

## Map in Java

![Map Hierarchy](/images/program-construction/map-hierarchy.png)

`Map` interface defines the basic operations for a map data structure.
`SortedMap` interface extends `Map` interface and provides additional methods
for sorted maps such as `firstKey()`, `lastKey()`, `headMap()`, `tailMap()`, and
`subMap()`.

Three primary classes implement these interfaces
[HashMap](/program-construction/hashmap/), `TreeMap`, and `LinkedHashMap`.
