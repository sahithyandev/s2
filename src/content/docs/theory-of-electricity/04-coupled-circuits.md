For all the definitions below, $N$ means the number of turns. $ $

### Self inductance

When the magnetic field produced by a coil causes an emf on itself. Denoted by $L$. When the length and area are constants, $L \propto N^2$.

### Mutual coupling

Mutual coupling between coils exist when one (secondary coil) is in the magnetic
field created by the other coil (primary coil).

When a time-varying current $i_p$ flows in the primary coil, a time-varying flux
$\phi_p$ is produced, which produces a back emf $e_p$.

## Magnetic field

### Magnetic flux density

Measure of strength and direction of the magnetic field. Denoted by $B$.
Measured in tesla ($T$) or $kgs^{-2}A^{-1}$ or $Nm^{-1}A^{-1}$.

### Magnetic flux

Denoted by $\phi$. Measured in weber ($Wb$).

```math
\phi = \int B\,\text{d}A = BA
```

For a coil having $L_p$ self inductance, $N$ turns, carrying current $i_p$, the generated $\phi_p$ is given by:

```math
L_p = \frac{N_p \phi_p}{i_p} = \frac{N_p^2 \mu A}{l}
```

### Magnetic field strength

Aka. magnetic field intensity. Denoted by $H$ (henry). Measured in ampere per meter ($Am^{-1}$).

### Magnetic permeability

Measure of magnetization on a material when a magnetic field is applied. Depends
on the material. Denoted by $\mu$. Meausred in $Hm^{-1}$ or $NA^{-2}$.

:::note

Relationship between magnetic flux, permeability, and intensity.

```math
B = \mu H
```

### Flux linkage

Denoted by $\lambda$. $ $

```math
\lambda = N\phi
```

### Magnetomotive force

A force acted on a coil carrying current. Denoted by $\text{mmf}$. $ $

```math
\mathfrak{f} = Ni
```

Here:

- $N$ - number of turns
- $i$ - current in the coil

It's similar to electromotive force in electrical circuits.

### Reluctance

Reluctance of a path for magnetic flux:

```math
\mathcal{R} = \frac{l}{\mu A} = \frac{\mathfrak{f}}{\phi}
```

Here:

- $l$ - Length of the path
- $\mu$ - Permeability
- $A$ - Cross-sectional area

The above equation can be thought of the equation of resistance in electrical context. $1/\mu$ is used instead of $\rho$.

$f=\mathcal{R}\phi$ is similar to $V=IR$ in electrical context.

:::note

For a toroidal core having $R$ radius and $r$ thickess:

```math
\mathcal{R} = \frac{2R}{\mu r^2}
```

:::

### Fringing

Flux lines in the air gap tend to bow out. Thus the effective area of air gap is larger than the cross sectional area of the core.

```math
A_\text{gap} = (\text{width} + \text{gap length}) \times (\text{thickness} + \text{gap length})
```

## Laws

### Faraday's Law

The magnetic flux passing through a surface A is given by the surface integral:

```math
\phi = \int {B\cdot \text{d}A} = BA
```

### Ampere's Law

Line integral of magnetic field intensity around a closed path is equal to the
sum of the currents owing through the surface bounded by the path.

```math
\oint H \cdot \text{d}l = \sum i
```

When $H$ is constant (magnitude and direction) along the path, the above
equation reduces to $Hl = \sum i$.

When $H$ is constant and the path has $N$ turns, $Hl = Ni$.

## Mutual inductance

When 2 coils are coupled, part of the magnetic flux produced in the primary coil
links with secondary coil.

### Coefficient of coupling

Ratio between the produced magnetic flux and linked magnetic flux. Denoted by
$k\;(\le 1)$. $ $

```math
\phi_s = k\phi_p
```

### Induced emf

Since the produced flux is time-varying, an emf $e_s$ is induced in the second
coil. $ $

```math
e_p = N_p \frac{\text{d}\phi_p}{\text{d}t}
```

```math
e_s = N_s \frac{\text{d}\phi_s}{\text{d}t}
```

In the linear region of magnetization characteristic:

```math
\phi_p \propto i_p \implies e_s
= \frac{N_s \phi_m}{i_p}\frac{\text{d}i_p}{\text{d}t}
= M_{SP} \frac{\text{d}i_p}{\text{d}t}
```

Here $M_{SP}$ is the mutual inductance. $ $

```math
M_{SP} = \frac{N_s \phi_s}{i_p} = \frac{k_{SP}N_sN_p\mu A}{l}
```

Practically, coupling between the primary and secondary coils is identical to
the coupling between secondary and primary coils.

```math
k_{SP} = k_{PS}
```

```math
M_{SP} = M_{PS}= M= k\sqrt{L_pL_s}
```

### Energy stored

```math
\text{Total stored energy}=
\int{v_pi_p\text{d}t}+
\int{v_si_s\text{d}t}
```

```math
\text{Total stored energy}=
\frac{1}{2}L_pi_p^2+
\frac{1}{2}L_si_s^2
\mp
Mi_pi_s
```

The last component is the effective energy stored in the mutual inductance.

The mutual inductance energy is:
- Added; if produced fluxes aid each other
- Subtracted; if produced fluxes oppose each other

## Equivalent inductance

### In series

```math
L_\text{eq} = L_1 + L_2 \pm 2M
```

The mutual inductance is:
- Added; if produced fluxes aid each other
- Subtracted; if produced fluxes oppose each other

### In parallel

```math
L_\text{eq} = \frac{L_1 L_2 - M^2}{L_1 + L_2 \mp 2M}
```

The mutual inductance in the denominator is:
- Subtracted; if produced fluxes aid each other
- Added; if produced fluxes oppose each other

### T-junction

If 2 coils are given in a T-junction, the circuit has to be changed to include a 3rd inductor. If the coils were aiding, the 3rd inductor will be $-M$, otherwise $M$. The 3rd inductor value will be subtracted from the other 2 inductors.

## Dot notation

One terminal of the coils is marked with a dot. If both currents enter or exit
from the dotted terminals, the fields aid; mutual inductance is positive.
Otherwise the fields oppose; mutual inductance is negative.

:::note

When a single coil is considered, the induced voltage would oppose the applied
voltage or the current flow.
