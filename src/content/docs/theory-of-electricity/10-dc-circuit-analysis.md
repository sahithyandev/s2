### DC Time Constant

Time required to charge the capacitor through the resistor from an initial
charge voltage of 0 to approximately $63.2%$ of the value of an applied DC
voltage. $ $

An alternate definition: Time required to discharge the capacitor through the
same resistor to approximately $36.8%$ of its initial charge voltage. $ $
