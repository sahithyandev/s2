Can either be repetitive or non-repetitive.

## Repetitive waveforms

The [Fourier series](/theory-of-electricity/fourier-series) can be used to represent them as a sum of sinusoidal components.

## Non-repetitive Waveforms

Waveforms that do not repeat over time. Can be idealized as a repetitive function with infinite period.

```math
f_0 = \lim_{T \to \infty} \frac{2\pi}{T} = \delta \omega_0
```

The [Fourier transform](/theory-of-electricity/fourier-transform) is used.
